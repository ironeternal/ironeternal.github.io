# Warband

You control 4 heroic adveturers delving into dungeons in hope of finding the dragon, slaying it, taking its treasure, and saving the princess. Each player controls a party of heros.

## Core



## Heroes

The types of heros are:

- **Defenders**: Defenders have the highest defenses in the game and good close-up offense. They are the party’s front-line combatants; wherever they’re standing, that’s where the action is. 
- **Leaders**: Leaders inspire, heal, and aid the other characters in an adventuring group. Leaders have good defenses, but their strength lies in powers that protect their companions and target specific foes for the party to concentrate on.
- **Strikers**: Strikers specialize in dealing high amounts of damage to a single target at a time. They have the most concentrated offense of any character in the game.  
- **Controllers**: Controllers deal with large numbers of enemies at the same time. They favor offense over defense, using powers that deal damage to multiple foes at once, as well as subtler powers that weaken, confuse, or delay their foes.

Each party has one of each. On the game board your defenders are represented by a d12, leaders by a d10, strikers by a d8, and controllers by a d4.

The avaliable heros for any adventure are:
