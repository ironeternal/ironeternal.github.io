# Warband

You control 4 heroic adveturers delving into dungeons in hope of finding the dragon, slaying it, taking its treasure, and saving the princess. Each player controls a party of heros.

## Core

The avaliable actions to each hero are:

- Move: move from the current room to an adjacent room
- Attack: roll to kill an enemy in the current room (or an adjacent room if a hero is ranged)
- Use an object
- Use a skill: You may only attempt an action if your character has the kind of class or skill that would allow them to do so. Standard DC for checks is 5 (on a d20 roll), hard checks are DC 10, and impossible checks are DC 15

### To Kill

To try and kill a creature roll 1d6 and add your HIT to the result. If the value is greater than 7 you have wounded the creature. Almost all creatures have 1 wound. If a creature is reduced to 0 wounds then it dies. You may do this a number of times equal to you ATK score as part of a single attack.

### To Defend

If a creature you then roll 1d6, if the value is greater than or equal to your DEF you successfully defend yourself. If you fail then you reduce your wounds by 1. All heroes have 1 wound (except fighters which have 2 wounds). If you have zero wounds then you are out-of-action. If the entire party is out-of-action then you lose the game.

# Heroes

The types of heros are:

- **Defenders**: Defenders have the highest defenses in the game and good close-up offense. They are the party’s front-line combatants; wherever they’re standing, that’s where the action is. 
- **Leaders**: Leaders inspire, heal, and aid the other characters in an adventuring group. Leaders have good defenses, but their strength lies in powers that protect their companions and target specific foes for the party to concentrate on.
- **Strikers**: Strikers specialize in dealing high amounts of damage to a single target at a time. They have the most concentrated offense of any character in the game.  
- **Controllers**: Controllers deal with large numbers of enemies at the same time. They favor offense over defense, using powers that deal damage to multiple foes at once, as well as subtler powers that weaken, confuse, or delay their foes.

Each party has one of each. On the game board your defenders are represented by a d12, leaders by a d10, strikers by a d8, and controllers by a d4.
