# Warband

You control 4 heroic adveturers delving into dungeons in hope of finding the dragon, slaying it, taking its treasure, and saving the princess. Each player controls a party of heros.

## Core

### Exploration

Each room in the dungeon is represented by a playing card, each turn the party as a whole may interact with something in the room, move to another room, do combat, or open a door revealing a new room. Every turn there is a 1 in 6 chance that a wandering monster will stumble into a room that the party has revealed. 

New rooms have:
- 1 in 4 chance of having a monster inside them
- 1 in 6 chance of having treasure inside of them
- 1 in 8 chance of having a magical item inside of them

The contents of a room are not revealed until the room is entered or the room is scryed. At the beginning of the adventure you have 0 treasure. New treasure is aquired by by clearing the room of all monsters. There is only ever 1 dragon. Killing the dragon wins the game.

When rolling on the monster and magical item table, roll 1d6 and add your total treasure to determine the result.

## Combat

The avaliable actions to each hero are:

- Move: move from the current room to an adjacent room
- Attack: roll to kill an enemy in the current room (or an adjacent room if a hero is ranged)
- Use an object
- Use a skill: You may only attempt an action if your character has the kind of class or skill that would allow them to do so. Standard DC for checks is 5 (on a d20 roll), hard checks are DC 10, and impossible checks are DC 15
- Stabilise: Make a DC5 check to stop an out-of-action ally from bleeding to death. When no enemies exist on the game board a stabilised creature returns to 1 wounds.

#### To Kill

To try and kill a creature roll 1d6 and add your HIT to the result. If the value is greater than 7 you have wounded the creature. Almost all creatures have 1 wound. If a creature is reduced to 0 wounds then it dies. You may do this a number of times equal to you ATK score as part of a single attack.

#### To Defend

If a creature you then roll 1d6, if the value is greater than or equal to your DEF you successfully defend yourself. If you fail then you reduce your wounds by 1. All heroes have 1 wound (except fighters which have 2 wounds). If you have zero wounds then you are out-of-action. While out-of-action you are bleeding to death. You can bleed to death for a number of turns equal to your level. Is no one stablises you before a number of turns equal to your level then you die. If the entire party dies then you lose the game.

# Heroes

The types of heros are:

- **Defenders**: Defenders have the highest defenses in the game and good close-up offense. They are the party’s front-line combatants; wherever they’re standing, that’s where the action is. 
- **Leaders**: Leaders inspire, heal, and aid the other characters in an adventuring group. Leaders have good defenses, but their strength lies in powers that protect their companions and target specific foes for the party to concentrate on.
- **Strikers**: Strikers specialize in dealing high amounts of damage to a single target at a time. They have the most concentrated offense of any character in the game.  
- **Controllers**: Controllers deal with large numbers of enemies at the same time. They favor offense over defense, using powers that deal damage to multiple foes at once, as well as subtler powers that weaken, confuse, or delay their foes.

Each party has one of each. On the game board your defenders are represented by a d12, leaders by a d10, strikers by a d8, and controllers by a d4.

The avaliable heros for any adventure are:

Each monster employs a strategy. Unless stated a creature is assumed to be a mindless destoyer:

- **Mindless Destroyer**: Attacks closest enemy. If not enemy is in the current room the creature will move action closer to the party.
- **Targeted**: Attacks closest enemy. Prioritises attacking PREFERED_FOE. If a PREFERED_FOE is in the current room, creature attacks PREFERED_FOE. If a PREFERED_FOE is one move action away, the creature will move to the PREFERED_FOE's room. If a PREFERED_FOE is not in the current room or one move action away a random enemy in the current room will be attacked. If the current room is has no heroes in it the creature will move towards a PREFERED_FOE if one is fighting-fight, otherwise the creature will move to a random hero.
	- **Snake Decapitator**: PREFERED_FOE is leaders
	- **Mage Slayer**: PREFERED_FOE is controllers
	- **Frontal Assault**: PREFERED_FOE is defenders
	- **Hunter Killer**: PREFERED_FOE is strikers
- **Commander**: Will use command if possible, before acting as a mindless destroyer
- **Coward**: Will perform a move action (or a slippery if possible) whenever it shares a room with an enemy.
