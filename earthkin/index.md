## Earthkith

> Earth kith or kith for short (earth kin/kin singular) are a small humanoid species than inhabit the continent. They're very similar to humans and have near identical physiology; however, at around 10 years old they cease to increase in height. The yexperience very similar puberties and maturity, but simply never increase in height. At their tallest they're 4 and a half feet (140 cm-ish). Their culture is strongly modelled off hobbits, goblins, and halflings.

## Armour

|Armour|AC bonus|Minimum Might|Cost (sp)|Notes|
|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|
|Chainkini*|0|0|25|+1 on social rolls|
|Brigandine|2|1|100||
|Maile|4|3|400|Medium|
|Curaiss|5|3|800|Medium|
|Panoply|6|4|1600|Heavy|
|Shield|2|1|50|Held, not worn|

> \*Maile of all kinds is considered a status symbol. Jewellery is often constructed with it. Wearing only large-linked chainmail and neglecting actual defence is a symbol of confidence and skill. Soldiers, civillians, and monsters all recognise it as a profound statement.

# Spells

<img src="https://i.redd.it/c5na07dyi7e51.jpg" width="400"/>

Roll 2d6 to determine spell strength:

- SUM: the sum of the two numbers
- PRODUCT: the product of the two numbers
- LARGE: the greater of the two numbers
- SMALL: the lesser of the two numbers

1. **Charm Person** (50ft, Person, 1 hr, Will): The person regards you as a good friend and ignores the obvious spell you just cast on them
2. **Death Mask** (touch, Humanoid Corpse, 1hr, Wits): You touch a corpse and the face peels off like a mask, while the rest of the corpse quickly rots into dust. When you (and only you) wear the mask, you will look and sound like the person whose face you're wearing, but only to sentient people (no effect on animals, spirits, or constructs). _This spell is considered evil_
3. **Feather** (touch, object, SUM rounds, None): Object's weight (but not mass) drops by 99%. You can cast this spell on yourself as a reaction (even when it isn't your turn).
4. **Grease** (50ft, surface, LARGE rounds, Finesse): Can be cast directly on a creature or a 10' x 10' surface. Grease causes held objects to be dropped and moving creatures to fall prone, if a finesse check is failed.
5. **Illusion** (50ft, 10ft diameter, Concentration, Wits): You create an illusion (basically a perfect hologram) of whatever object or creature you want. It can move as long however you dictate, but it cannot make any sound (or smell, touch, etc). Remember that illusions can only add, not subtract. (They can cover up a hole, but not create the illusion of a hole).
6. **Light** (touch, object, 4 hrs): Object illuminates within 30ft. With a successful attack roll, you can touch a creature's face, blinding them with glare.
7. **Magic Missile** (200ft. creature): Create LARGE missles that each deal 1 damage (may be split among targets), no save or resistance.
8. **Raise Skeleton** (touch, corpse, concentration): Target becomes a skeleton (AC5, 5hp, +0 to everything) that will kill living creatures on sight (otherwise idle). Make Will checks to command them to move, kill, or not kill. They're otherwise mindless. Can be equiped with weapons and armor. You can learn this spell more than once to cast it more than once at a time. _This spell is considered evil_
9. **Animate Object** (touch, object, 1hr, Will): Target become friendly creature (AC5, 5hp, +0 to everything) that can move under their own power. Make Will checks to command them. They're about as smart as a trained dog, and can talk. You can learn this spell more than once to cast it more than once at a time.
0. **Filtch** (50ft, object small enough to be wield 1 handed, Might): Target object is either teleported to your hand or from your hand to a location you can see. To take an object requires whatever is holding it to fail a Might check.
