> Earth kith or kith for short (earth kin/kin singular) are a small humanoid species than inhabit the continent. They're very similar to humans and have near identical physiology; however, at around 10 years old they cease to increase in height. They experience very similar puberties and maturity, but simply never increase in height. At their tallest they're 4 and a half feet (140 cm-ish). Their culture is strongly modeled off hobbits, goblins, and halflings.

You start the game with 4 kith and an adventuring group called a fungather.

# Kit

## Starting kit

- 2 handed weapon or 1 handed/light weapon and shield (AC +2) or Shillelagh & Censer
- Brigandine Armour (min Might 1, AC +2) or Maile (min Might 3, AC +4) or Chainkini (+1 on social rolls)

Shared among your 4 kin you have:

- Personal/luxury item (e.g. bottle of wine, scarf, big hat, or arm chair)
- Sentimental item (e.g. locket, ring, or photograph)
- Quest item (e.g. broken sword hilt, mysterious key, torn letter, or treasure map)
- No money

All fungathers are equipped with standard adventuring equipment (rope, first aid kit, tinderbox, bedroll, water skin, etc). If there is a specific item you would like to have, have the smartest Kin in your party to a DC7 wits check.

## Weapons

|Weapon|Usage|Damage Type|Standard Hit|Strong Hit|Cost|Special (sp)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Fist|-|Blunt|5|10|-||

|.|.|.|.|.|.|.|
|Bow|2 Handed|Pointy|8|16|60|+1 to combat, Ranged|

- Light weapons may be thrown
- 2 Handed weapons have greater range and are more able to strike foes without exposing the wielder (+1 on combat)
- Blunt weapons tend to bounce off target but when the land a solid hit they crush and shatter with greater power than other weapons (+6 damage on strong hit)
- Pointy weapons are more able to leverage their size for offense and defense increasing their likelihood to wound (+1 on combat)
- Glancing hits with Sharp weapons result in deep slashes, all hits from Sharp weapons deal slightly more damage than other weapons (+3 damage on hit)

## Armour

|Armour|AC bonus|Minimum Might|Cost (sp)|Notes|
|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|
|Chainkini*|0|0|25|+1 on social rolls|
|Brigandine|2|1|100||
|Maile|4|3|400|Medium|
|Curaiss|5|3|800|Medium|
|Panoply|6|4|1600|Heavy|
|Shield|2|1|50|Held, not worn|

> \*Maile of all kinds is considered a status symbol. Jewelery is often constructed with it. Wearing only large-linked chain mail and neglecting actual defense is a symbol of confidence and skill. Soldiers, civilians, and monsters all recognize it as a profound statement.

# Spells

<img src="https://i.redd.it/c5na07dyi7e51.jpg" width="400"/>

Spells require the caster to say a loud incantation, wave around a censer in one hand, and gesture with a Shillelagh (staff) in the other. 

Roll 2d6 to determine spell strength:

- SUM: the sum of the two numbers
- PRODUCT: the product of the two numbers
- LARGE: the greater of the two numbers
- SMALL: the lesser of the two numbers

1. **Glamour Person** (50ft, Person, 1 hr, Will): The person regards you as a good friend and ignores the obvious spell you just cast on them
2. **Deathmask** (touch, Humanoid Corpse, 1hr, Wits): You touch a corpse and the face peels off like a mask, while the rest of the corpse quickly rots into dust. When you (and only you) wear the mask, you will look and sound like the person whose face you're wearing, but only to sentient people (no effect on animals, spirits, or constructs). _This spell is considered evil_
3. **Featherfall** (touch, object, SUM rounds, None): Object's weight (but not mass) drops by 99%. You can cast this spell on yourself as a reaction (even when it isn't your turn).
4. **Icewash** (50ft, surface, LARGE rounds, Finesse): Can be cast directly on a creature or a 10' x 10' surface making it slippery and cold. Icewash causes held objects to be dropped and moving creatures to fall prone, if a finesse check is failed.
5. **Visual Illusion** (50ft, 10ft diameter, Concentration, Wits): You create an illusion (basically a perfect hologram) of whatever object or creature you want. It can move as long however you dictate, but it cannot make any sound (or smell, touch, etc). Remember that illusions can only add, not subtract. (They can cover up a hole, but not create the illusion of a hole).
6. **Light** (touch, object, 4 hrs): Object illuminates within 30ft. With a successful attack roll, you can touch a creature's face, blinding them with glare.
7. **Magic Missile** (200ft. creature): Create LARGE missles that each deal 1 damage (may be split among targets), no save or resistance.
8. **Raise Skeleton** (touch, corpse, concentration): Target becomes a skeleton (AC5, 5hp, +0 to everything) that will kill living creatures on sight (otherwise idle). Make Will checks to command them to move, kill, or not kill. They're otherwise mindless. Can be equipped with weapons and armor. You can learn this spell more than once to cast it more than once at a time. _This spell is considered evil_
9. **Animate Object** (touch, object, 1hr, Will): Target become friendly creature (AC5, 5hp, +0 to everything) that can move under their own power. Make Will checks to command them. They're about as smart as a trained dog, and can talk. You can learn this spell more than once to cast it more than once at a time.
0. **Filch Object** (50ft, object small enough to be wield 1 handed, Might): Target object is either teleported to your hand or from your hand to a location you can see. To take an object requires whatever is holding it to fail a Might check.

# Leveling and dying

<img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/774ba779aea0b74b42783e5af80c3cb2/efe201e0d99cf176-eb/s1280x1920/20b05eab201e19f31ccfc5daaaa07d123430540f.jpg" width="400"/>

- A kin will die if its fails a death save. It must make a death (Will) save every turn it has negative hit points and does not receive medical attention. The DC for all death related checks is equal to the magnitude of the kin's hit points. Sawbones + finesse check will stabilize a kin.
- You gain experience when you do something noteworthy, bring back 100 GP in treasure, and a member of your fungather dies valiantly. To level a kin costs a number of experience equal to the kin's current level.
- If your entire fungather dies then you lose all of your experience, equipment, and you start again with a fresh fungather.
- If a fungather member dies you can try to convince someone to join the fungather, pay someone (100 gp), or find some other means.
