## How do you do?

Your characters are heros. Unless there is something actively resisting them or an action is incredible dangerous you won't need to roll to complete an action. However, on a standard set of actions there is a 1 in 6 chance that something unexpected or unintended will occur. 

When you want to attempt a dangerous action you roll 2d6 and check the values. If the sum of the two dice is greater than 7 you succeed. If the two dice have the same value (doubles) something unexpected will occur. You gain a bonus on the roll (added to the result) if there are factors making the outcome more likely. You may propose up to three reasons why something is likely to work in your favour, and the opposition may propose two. The reasons you give may cancel out or invalidate other reasons. When you are attempting an action it MUST be a single action; you can not fire a gun, patch a wound, and do a hand brake turn as part of the same action. 

> Example: Indiana wants to jump his motorbike into the back of a speeding truck to rescue the damsel. His player Andy says this is likely to happen as 1) Indiana loves to ride motorbikes 2) he's cool under pressure 3) the roof of the truck is already torn open. The villains say that this won't happen because 1) the truck is swerving all over the road and 2) the baddies are going to be shooting at him the whole time. The story teller decides that the first reason given by the baddies is valid, but the second only describes how the jump might not go exactly to plan.

Additionally you might **go all in**, and stake a reason at risk of burning it. When you do so you may ignore the lower of the two dice you roll and double the result of the highest dice that you roll. However, if you still fail the roll then you lose the reasons.

> Example: Indiana wants to drive another car off the road. He's given a bunch of reasons, and he's going to **go all in** and stake the car. He's doing to slam his car against the other car resulting in him or them going over the edge. He rolls, he gets a 1 and a 4 with a +1. The total is 6 (1 + 4 + 1), which would normally be a failure, but because he risked it all on the car we ignore the 1 and count the 4 twice for a total of 9 (4 + 4 + 1) and its a double! So Indiana pushes the car off the edge, and the shapnel slows down the pursuers behind him. Had he failed it would have been especially bad, not only would he have failed (giving the villains an opportunioty to act against him), but he would have lost the car forever and found himself in a perilous position (possibly hanging from a branch on the edge of the cliff).

## [Whats your name?](https://youtu.be/OV5WUmctA2Q)

Think about the kind of character you want to play. Are you the adventurous ex-soldier looking for a dame and a dollar? The plucky art dealer who's gambaling debts have just come due? The secretly attractive librarian keen to make a name for herself? The slimey desserter and scoudnrel working for both sides? The univeristy historian trying to save his religous and neglectful father?

The character you make should be larger than life which big virtues, clear weaknesses, and strong motivation. They're going to be charging head first into danger.

In a single word or short phrase answer the following questions about yourself:

1. What is/was your job?
1. What were you especially good at?
1. How do you deal with your problems?
1. What do you fear?
1. What have you learned from your failures?
1. What timebomb lurks in your past?
1. Why do your friends like you?
1. What kind of reputation do you have?
1. What do you believe in with all your heart and soul?
1. Whats your secret obsession?
1. What is most precious and sacred to you?
1. How do you look?
1. What are you wearing?
1. Whats in your right hand?
1. Whats in your left hand?
1. Whats in your satchel?
1. Whats in your luggage?
1. Who can you call on for a favour at 2am?
1. Why are you willing to risk your life for good?
