- Piecing weapons are more able to leverage their size for offence and defence increasing their likelihood to wound (+1 on combat)
- Glancing hits with cutting weapons result in deep slashes, all hits from cutting weapons deal slightly more damage than other weapons (+3 damage on hit)

## Armour

|Armour|AC bonus|Minimum Power|Cost (sp)|Notes|

|Curaiss|5|3|800||
|Panoply|6|4|1600||
|Shield|2|1|50||

> \*Maile of all kinds is considered a status symbol. Jewellery is often constructed with it. Wearing only large-linked chainmail and neglecting actual defence is a symbol of confidence and skill. Soldiers, civillians, and monsters all recognise it as a profound statment.

# Core
## Checks

Roll 2d20 + Skill + Ability vs DC or 10 + Skill + Ability

- if 2 rolls are greater than threshold its a STRONG success
- if 1 roll is greater than threshold its a WEAK success
- if no rolls are greater than threshold its a FAIL

## Combat

Roll 2d20 + combat (Power (or Finese if ranged) + prowess + weapon bonus + AC) vs defence (10 + AC + prowess)

- if 2 rolls are greater than threshold its a STRONG hit
- if 1 roll is greater than threshold its a WEAK hit
- if no rolls are greater than threshold its a FAIL

On a WEAK hit deal WEAK hit damage. On a STRONG hit deal STRONG hit damage or deal WEAK hit damage and perform a special attack. Power is added to all melee attack rolls, only the bow and sling use Finese to hit.

- WEAK hit damage: WEAK + Power
- STRONG hit damage: STRONG + Power

### Special Attacks

- **Targeted**: hit a specific part of the target
- **Disarm**: disarm the target
- **Trip**: trip the target
- **Shove**: shove the target
- **Disengage**: target can not take OOP until their next turn
- **Fient**: removes prowess bonus from target defence until their next turn

## Magic

[Spell list can be found here](spells.md)

You may cast any spell you know as many times per day as you like. To cast a spell find the power cost of the spell, subtract it from your avaliable arcane power to find your spell casting modifier. Roll 1d20 adding your spell casting modifier to the roll. If the result is 10 or higher the spell is cast successfully, on a 9 or less the spell fizzles and nothing happens. The saving throw DC for a spell is equal to 10 + your spellcasting modifier.

You can NOT maintain concentration on a spell that you have a negative spell modifier for, checks to maintain concentration automatically fail.

Your arcane power must be assigned to a specific demon lord (e.g. Drakon, Orlock, or Moloch) and only applies to spells within their tradition. You may attempt to cast any spell from any tradtion that you have at least one point of arcane power with a -5 penalty to your spell modifier.

E.g.

- A character has an arcane power of 3, and tries to cast Bind Judicium (P:3). All of the characters arcane power are used on the spell so they have a casting modifier of +0 (3-3). They roll 1d20 and get an 10, successfully casting the spell. As the spell is a concentration spell those 3 points arcane power are locked until the spell is dismissed.
- A character has an arcane power of 5, and tries to cast Conjure Imp (P:0). None the characters arcane power are used on the spell so they have a casting modifier of +5 (5-0). They roll 1d20 and get an 4, with their modifier they get a 9, failing to casts the spell
- A character has an arcane power of 3, and tries to cast Ember (P:1). One the characters arcane power points are used on the spell so they have a casting modifier of +2 (3-1). They roll 1d20 and get an 9, with their modifier they get an 11, and successfully cast the spell.
- A character has an arcane power of 5, and tries to cast Dragonbreath (P:9). All of the characters arcane power are used on the spell so they have a casting modifier of -4 (5-9). They roll 1d20 and get an 15, with their modifier they get a 11, and successfully cast the spell.
- A character has an arcane power of 3, and tries to cast Ember (P:1) which they don't know how to cast. One the characters arcane power points are used on the spell so they have a casting modifier of -3 (3-1-5). They roll 1d20 and get an 9, with their modifier they get a 6, failing to cast the spell.
- A character has an arcane power of 1, and tries to cast Bind Judicium (P:3). All of the characters arcane power are used on the spell so they have a casting modifier of -2 (3-3). They instantly fail to cast the spell as they do not have enough arcane power.
