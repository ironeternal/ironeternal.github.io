# Magic

Certain rituals are only possible at certain points during the day. Some require the full moon, some the midday sun. The ritual to imbue wand cores with magic is only possible at twilight. The ritual is complicated and requires technique, concentration, and precision. Spellcasting is like juggling, greater skill means more balls in the air at once. A more competent arcanist is capable of embuing more cores during the crepuscular hour resukting in more spells per day.


Specific hex cores are required for certain spells. Arcanists may only cast the set of spells for which they have cores.
