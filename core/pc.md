# Magic

Certain rituals are only possible at certain points during the day. Some require the full moon, some the midday sun. The ritual to imbue wand cores with magic is only possible at twilight. The ritual is complicated and requires technique, concentration, and precision. Spellcasting is like juggling, greater skill means more balls in the air at once. A more competent arcanist is capable of embuing more cores during the crepuscular hour resukting in more spells per day.

Specific hex cores are required for certain spells. Arcanists may only cast the set of spells for which they have cores.

## Common Cores

- Amber encrusted pine: Materials, creation, transmutations
- Troll blood soaked yew: Protection, healing, time
- Walnut with hag whisker inlay: Emotions, illusions, perception
- Elm and lycanthrope leather lamellar: Shapeshifting, light, fear
- Ash scorched in dragon fire: Elements, oaths, truth
- Holly with orc tusk core: Conjuration, divination, retribution

- Quest item (e.g. broken sword hilt, mysterious key, torn letter, or treasure map)

All adventurers are equipt with standard adventuring equipment (rope, bedroll, waterskin, etc).

## Weapons

Weapons may have the following properties:

- **Light**: 4/8 damage, light weapons may be thrown
- **1 Handed**: 8/16 damage
- **2 Handed**: 10/20 damage, +1 on combat
- **Bashing**: +weak damage on strong hit, bashing weapons tend to bounce off target but when the land a solid hit they crush and shatter with greater power than other weapons
- **Piercing**: +1 on combat, piecing weapons are more able to leverage their size for offence and defence increasing their likelihood to wound
- **Cutting**: +3 damage on hit, glancing hits with cutting weapons result in effective slashes, all hits do slightly more damage than other weapons

Examples include:
- Short spear: 8/16, +1 on combat
- Longsword: 11/19
- Claymore: 13/20, +1 on combat
- 1 handed mace: 8/24
- Poleaxe: 10/30
- Sap: 4/12
- Bow: 8/16, +1 on combat
- Sling: 4/12


Else

- A natural twenty transforms a miss to a weak hit, a weak hit to a strong, a strong to a wounding hit, and a wounding hit to a wounding hit with +10.
- Weapon specialisation grants +2 to hit and can only be applied to a given weapon once. Specialisation applies to all weapons with the same tags (e.g. 1 handed cutting weapons would apply to the longsword, boarding axe, khopesh, and katana but not morning star or claymore)

## Armour

|Armour|AC bonus|Minimum Fitness|Cost (sp)|Notes|
|:-|-:|-:|-:|
|Chainkini*|0|0|25|+1 charisma|
|Brigandine|2|1|50||
|Maile|4|3|400||
|Curaiss|5|3|800||
|Panopoly|6|4|1600||
|Shield|2|1|50||

> *Maile of all kinds is considered a status symbol. Jewellery is often constructed with it. Wearing only large-linked chainmail and neglecting actual defence is a symbol of confidence and skill. Warriors, civillians, and monsters all recognise it as a profound statment.
