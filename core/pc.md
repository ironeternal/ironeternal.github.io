- Weapon specialisation grants +2 to hit and can only be applied to a given weapon once. Specialisation applies to all weapons with the same tags (e.g. 1 handed cutting weapons would apply to the longsword, boarding axe, khopesh, and katana but not morning star or claymore)

### Subsystem

Weapons may have the following properties:

- **Light**: 4/8 damage, light weapons may be thrown
- **1 Handed**: 8/16 damage
- **2 Handed**: 10/20 damage, +1 on combat
- **Bashing**: +6 damage on strong hit, bashing weapons tend to bounce off target but when the land a solid hit they crush and shatter with greater power than other weapons
- **Piercing**: +1 on combat, piecing weapons are more able to leverage their size for offence and defence increasing their likelihood to wound
- **Cutting**: +3 damage on hit, glancing hits with cutting weapons result in effective slashes, all hits do slightly more damage than other weapons

## Armour

|Armour|AC bonus|Minimum Fitness|Cost (sp)|Notes|
|:-|-:|-:|-:|
|Chainkini*|0|0|25|+1 charisma|
|Brigandine|2|1|100||
|Maile|4|3|400||
|Curaiss|5|3|800||
|Panoply|6|4|1600||
|Shield|2|1|50||

> *Maile of all kinds is considered a status symbol. Jewellery is often constructed with it. Wearing only large-linked chainmail and neglecting actual defence is a symbol of confidence and skill. Soldiers, civillians, and monsters all recognise it as a profound statment.


### Subsystem:
- Cost: 25*2^AC, half for shields
- Min fitness: (AC) / 2 (rounded up)
