# Magic


Humans aren't magic, they can't do magic. They can activate things that are magical. They can capture and channel magical beings. They can invoke existing magical effects. Then can imbibe magical things.


## Spell limits

Certain rituals are only possible at certain points during the day. Some require the full moon, some the midday sun. The ritual to imbibe


The ritual to embue demon blood with vril is only possible at twilight when crepuscular light filters through the arcane iccor revealing certain impurities. The ritual is complicated and requires technique, concentration, and precision. Spellcasting is like juggling, greater skill means more balls in the air at once. A more competent witch or wizard is capable of purifying more vials during the hour resulting in more spells per day.

Specific wands and cores are required for certain spells. Witches and wizards may only cast the set of spells for which they have cores.

## Cores

Cores are the heart of a wand and allow for the focusing of magical energies. The dividing lines between spells and their schools are arbitrary, but are vaguely defined as thus:

- **Illusion (Charisma):** Spells that alter perception, such as Invisibility and Charm.
- **Conjuration (Education):** Spells that summon creatures and equipment from other worlds, such as Bound Items and Summon.
- **Alteration (Education):** Spells that manipulate the laws of nature, such as Water Breathing and Levitation.
- **Destruction (Wits):** Spells that cause physical harm, such as Fire Damage and Damage Attribute.
- **Mysticism (Charisma):**  Spells that shape and focus ethereal forces, such as Telekinesis and Soultrap.
- **Restoration (Wits):** Spells that heal, such as Restore Health and Cure Common Disease.

The composition of wands and cores results in a finite number of spells being avaliable to a given witch at a given time. All wands conform to the follow spell list:
- Primary school (sun): 3 spells from a spell list
- Secondary school (moon): 2 spells from a spell list that does not use the same primary attribute as the sun list
- Tertiary school (star): 1 spell from a spell list that is not the sun or moon
- Freebie (fool): 1 spell from any list

Three common wand configurations are as follows:
- All seeing owl: Walnut with hag whisker inlay
  - **Sun: Mysticism (C)**: Raise _____, Death Mask, Scry
  - **Moon: Conjuration (E)**: Fog cloud, Catherine
  - **Stars: Illusion (C)**: Illusion
  - **Fool: Illusion (C)**: Sleep
- Goblin Switchblade: Holly with goblin tusk core
  - **Sun: Conjuration (E)**: Floating disk, Mirror Object, Filtch
  - **Moon: Destruction (W)**: Light, Fireball
  - **Stars: Alteration (E)**: Spiderclimb
  - **Fool: Illusion (C)**: Fear
- Hellscream Dragon: Ash scorched in dragon fire
  - **Sun: Destruction (W)**: Magic Missle, Fireball, Ascendio
  - **Moon: Conjuration (E)**: Fog cloud, Mirror Object
  - **Stars: Restoration (W)**: Restore Health

  - **Moon: Alteration (E)**: Spiderclimb, Levitate
  - **Stars: Destruction (W)**: Expelliarmus
  - **Fool: Mysticism (C)**: Magic Mouth

# Casting

Casting a spell will normally require that the caster roll a check. On a strong hit the spell is cast. On a weak hit the core detonates and is destoryed; the spell is cast but the core is no longer usable for spell casting.

## Befuddled

Befuddled creatures cannot tell any two creatures apartâ€”everyone looks the same to them. Whenever they attack, they attack a random creature. When a Befuddled creature casts a spell, they cast a random spell at a target picked randomly from all eligible ones. Whenever they try to run through a door, they run through a random door.
